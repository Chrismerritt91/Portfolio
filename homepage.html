                    Greetings, I'm a full-stack web developer and Army veteran. I am highly adaptive and work well as a team member or as an individual. I am dedicated to creating clean and flexible code to provide users with the quality they expect.
                </p>
                <h4><span class="pb-1">Languages</span></h4>
                <p class="mt-3 p-2 aboutP">HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Java SE, Java EE (Servlets, JSP), Spring, MySQL, Thymeleaf</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container d-flex mt-2">
            <div class="card p-1 m-1 col-4">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title text-center"><span class="pb-1">Where I'm Coming From</span></h5>
                    <p class="card-text mt-3 p-2 aboutP">Started out as a wheeled-vehicle mechanic at Ft. Lewis, WA, where I learned the finer points of leadership, teamwork, and accountability. After almost five years I was medically separated from the Army, and returned to Texas. I attended 2 different colleges with a focus in science, however I had to end my time one semester shy of an associates degree to return to work. I fell back on my experience as a mechanic, and over the course of three years, I achieved the position of co-foreman. Once I left that job, I attended a web-developer bootcamp to pursue a career in tech.</p>

            <div class="card p-1 m-1 col-4">
                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title text-center"><span class="pb-1">Where I Am</span></h5>
                    <p class="card-text mt-3 p-2 aboutP">I have now completed my education for full stack web-development, and now I am seeking employment as well as other opportunities to grow. I am looking for on-site full-time employment in the greater Houston area, or a full-time remote position. While I am searching for a job I am also working on personal projects, completing coding challenges on different platforms, and learning new languages. In any free time I have, I make sure to take every chance I get to spend with my wife and daughters.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title text-center"><span class="pb-1">Where I Hope To Be</span></h5>
                    <p class="card-text mt-3 p-2 aboutP">Over the coming years, I hope to be working with a great team supporting people from all over. I want to work my way up to manage projects, and work as a leader to guide and support others. I will also continue to work on side projects, if time permits. I will also donate time to work with non-profit companies, with a focus on helping organizations that serve veterans.</p>
